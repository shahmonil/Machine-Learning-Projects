- ### Machine Learning

  - [Predicting Diabetes](https://github.com/shahmonil/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Diabetes%20Prediction/Diabetes%20Prediction.ipynb): A model to predict whether a person has diabetes or not using various parameters like Glucose, Blood Pressure etc. Used a XGBoost model with hyperparameter tuning to achieve an accruacy of 80%. 
  - [Heart Stroke Prediction](https://github.com/shahmonil/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Heart%20stroke%20Prediction/Heart%20Stroke%20Prediction.ipynb): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual will have a heart stroke in the future.Used auc_roc_score as the metric and achieved a score of 0.84
  - [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://github.com/shahmonil/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/Titanic%20Kaggle%20Competition/Titanic%20Kaggle.ipynb): Participated in a Kaggle competition (solo) to predict the survival of a paticular passenger. Placed in the top 17% of the leaderboard. 

  -Tools: Pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Ploty, Statsmodels
